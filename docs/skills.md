# Claude-compatible skills

Skills are on-demand instruction bundles the agent can load mid-session via the
`skill` tool. dirge reads the same format as Claude and opencode.

Place skill directories in `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, or
`.dirge/skills/` in your project or home directory. Each skill is a directory
containing `SKILL.md` with optional YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A helpful skill
---
# Instructions
Detailed skill content here.
```

Skills are auto-discovered at agent startup and listed in the `skill` tool
description. The agent can call `skill "my-skill"` to load the full content on
demand. Project skills override global skills by name.

## Bundled starter skills

The repo ships a small pack of general-purpose workflow skills under
[`skills/`](../skills/) — `systematic-debugging`, `code-review-feedback`, and
`writing-skills`. They are **not** installed automatically; copy the ones you
want into a discovered location, e.g. `cp -r skills/systematic-debugging
.dirge/skills/` (per project) or `~/.dirge/skills/` (global). See
[skills/README.md](../skills/README.md).
