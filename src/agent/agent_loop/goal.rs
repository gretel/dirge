//! Goal gate: an opt-in, user-defined natural-language stop condition for
//! autonomous runs (`--loop`, the MCP delegate). At the finalization
//! boundary an independent judge decides whether the stated goal is
//! actually met; if not, its reason re-enters the loop and the run
//! continues, bounded by [`MAX_GOAL_REACT`] so a mis-stated or
//! unsatisfiable goal can't loop forever. OFF unless a goal is set AND a
//! judge (the critic provider) is configured — no cost on a default
//! session.
//!
//! Mirrors [`super::critic`]: it reuses the [`CriticFn`] judge callback
//! built in the provider layer, and owns the prompt, verdict parsing, and
//! loop-message wiring here so they're unit-testable without a model. The
//! difference from the critic is intent and cardinality — the critic is a
//! one-shot "is this correct/complete" review; the goal gate persists
//! across finalizations until the user's explicit stop condition holds.
