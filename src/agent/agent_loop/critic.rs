//!

//! boundary: given the user's request and the work done this run, is the

//!
//! The actual LLM call is a [`CriticFn`] callback (mirrors

\n\
Hard rules:\n\
- RESPECT the assistant's instructions. NEVER flag the absence of an action the instructions \
forbid or defer (e.g. if it was told not to push/commit/deploy, do NOT ask it to). Treat anything \
the instructions place out of scope as correctly omitted.\n\
- Block only on CONCRETE, in-scope incompleteness with evidence (e.g. the user asked for X and X \
is missing; a change was made but never built/tested when verification was expected).\n\
- A tool result tagged `[DENIED]` (or whose text begins `Permission denied` / `Auto-approval \
denied`) is a PERMISSION block, not a failure to fix. Treat that capability as out of scope: \
never demand the assistant retry it, route around it, or accomplish the blocked action some \
other way. Judge the rest of the work as if that action were correctly deferred to the user.\n\
- A block marked `[CONTEXT COMPACTION — REFERENCE ONLY]` (or a `## Active Task` lifted from one) \
describes ALREADY-COMPLETED prior work — never treat it as an outstanding requirement. Judge only \
the latest request and the transcript.\n\
- Do NOT invent new requirements, scope, or \"nice to haves\". If you cannot determine correctness from \
the spec and evidence available, ABSTAIN — say what's missing (e.g. no test covering this change, \
unclear acceptance criteria). An abstention is safer than a false pass. If you are unsure whether \
there's a real gap, PASS — a false block wastes a whole turn.";
