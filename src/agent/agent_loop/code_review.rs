//! A sibling to the completeness [`critic`](super::critic): where the
//! critic judges "is the task done?" from the transcript, this reviewer
//! judges "is the changed CODE correct?" from the actual diff, and emits
//! structured, severity-ranked [`Finding`]s. It reuses the critic's judge
//! plumbing ([`CriticFn`](super::critic::CriticFn) + the shared
//! `critic_provider` client) — no new provider config — so it's the same
//! opt-in with a different preamble and a findings pipeline.
//!
//! The prompt craft and the verdict/finding model are ported from roborev
//! (`internal/prompt/templates/default_review.md.gotmpl`,
//! `default_security.md.gotmpl`, and `internal/storage/verdict.go`); the
//! daemon/queue/sqlite infrastructure around them is not relevant to an
//! in-loop reviewer and is deliberately left behind.
//!
//! This module is the PURE core: the preambles, the [`Severity`] /
//! [`Finding`] types, and the parser. The finalization wiring, diff
//! capture, two-pass verify, and severity gate are wired around it in
//! the agent loop.

You are a code reviewer for an autonomous coding agent. You are given a unified diff of the code \

Review the DIFF for defects.\n\
\n\
Read the request and transcript to understand intent, then check whether the diff correctly and \
completely achieves it — gaps between stated intent and actual implementation are high-value \
findings. If intent is vague, infer it from the diff itself and skip the intent-alignment check.\n\
\n\
Check for:\n\
1. Intent-implementation gaps: does the diff actually accomplish what was asked?\n\
2. Bugs: logic errors, off-by-one errors, null/None issues, race conditions.\n\
3. Security: injection, auth issues, data exposure.\n\
4. Testing gaps: missing unit tests, edge cases not covered.\n\
5. Regressions: changes that might break existing functionality.\n\
6. Code quality: duplication that should be refactored, overly complex logic, unclear naming.\n\
\n\
Do not report issues without specific evidence in the diff. In particular, do NOT report:\n\
- Hypothetical issues in code not shown in the diff.\n\
- Style preferences or naming opinions that do not affect correctness.\n\
- \"Missing tests\" unless the change introduces testable behavior with no coverage.\n\
- Patterns that are consistent with the codebase conventions visible in context.\n\
- The absence of an action the assistant was explicitly told not to take (commit, push, deploy, \
etc.). Treat anything out of scope as correctly omitted — never demand it.\n\
\n\
Judge whether a feature or API exists from the project's toolchain and dependency manifests \
(Cargo.toml, package.json, go.mod, pyproject.toml, …), not your own memory, which may be stale. \
Do not flag valid recent APIs as broken, and do not miss calls to APIs that genuinely do not \
exist for the project's versions.";

  - high: will cause data loss, security breach, crash, or incorrect results in production.\n\
  - medium: degraded behavior under specific conditions, or blocks future maintainability.\n\
  - low: minor improvement with no immediate functional impact.\n\
- File and line reference where possible (the narrowest applicable location).\n\
- What specifically goes wrong if this is not fixed (concrete harm, not \"violates best \
