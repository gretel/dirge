//! Janet runs on a dedicated OS thread.
//!
//! The original `PluginManager` held the `JanetClient` directly and relied
//! on `#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]` + an `unsafe impl Send`
//! to satisfy `rig::ToolDyn`'s Send bound on tool-call futures. That was
//! sound under the existing single-thread runtime but blocked synchronous
//! dialog APIs (`harness/confirm`, `harness/select`) — they would have
//! deadlocked, since the Janet eval call sat on the same OS thread that
//! also drove the UI event loop.
//!
//! This module spawns a dedicated worker thread that owns the
//! `JanetClient`. Callers send [`Cmd`]s to the worker via an mpsc channel
//! and block-receive replies on per-command oneshot reply channels. The
//! UI thread is free to render dialogs while the worker thread is blocked
//! inside Janet awaiting a dialog response.
